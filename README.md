# Vinterior_Test
Coding test for the Vinterior tech team. 

I am quite unfamiliar with Ruby, and so found this exercise quite challenging. I initially thought about completing the exercise in Java (as I have mostly used Java for OO programming), however decided it would benefit me to familiarise myself with Ruby anyway.

Inital approach	: Object oriented approach, building separate files for Checkout, Item, and Promotional Offers.
				: Must also include Pricing class.
				: Having trouble with PromRules.
